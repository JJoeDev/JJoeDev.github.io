            <description>Hello there This is my initial commit for a blog post on my site. Awesome I know.
I switched to using Hugo for generating my site because I am a programmer at heart and I cannot make a site that looks good by only using HTML and CSS
Anyways the initial post is going to be short as it is basically just here to be here :D
