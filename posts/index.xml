            <description>Programming language thoughts I feel like I am always looking for a different low level programming language alternative to C++, but always end up back at C++.
I have been looking at Zig lang, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to learn about their allocators, no good excuse really.
Then I have been looking at Odin lang, but last time I was trying it their linux support wasn&amp;rsquo;t really there. The Arch package was outdated and didn&amp;rsquo;t come with their vendor directory.</description>

<p>I feel like I am always looking for a different low level programming language alternative to C++, but always end up back at C++.</p>
<p>I have been looking at Zig lang, but I didn&rsquo;t really want to learn about their allocators, no good excuse really.</p>
<p>Then I have been looking at Odin lang, but last time I was trying it their linux support wasn&rsquo;t really there. The Arch package was outdated and didn&rsquo;t come with their vendor directory.
Then they wanted me to compile it from source to get the latest version that included everything, and it was actually quite fun to try.</p>
<p>I have also recently been looking at D lang again, but when they showed me this code, well, no&hellip; that just feels wrong.
Here is what they showed me&hellip;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-d" data-lang="d"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Starting program&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">writeln</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But I also read somewhere that D does have a garbage collector, but it can be turned off. Im not sure how I feel about having an optional GC.
It could be awesome for testing stuff, but I also don&rsquo;t want to rely on it. And then there where these guys</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-D" data-lang="D"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">@safe</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">@trusted</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">@system</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sure they could be awesome for more performance, But its just not the same. I have no idea how to describe it, it just isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So that is how I always end up back at C++, and every time I realize that I don&rsquo;t really need to change language because C++ does what I want it to do when I use it.
Sure CMake is a pain to work with at times, and libraries are also a pain most of the time. But that is just C++, and I have learned to love the pain it can bring</p>

            <description>Hello there This is my initial commit for a blog post on my site. Awesome I know.
I switched to using Hugo for generating my site because I am a programmer at heart and I cannot make a site that looks good by only using HTML and CSS
Anyways the initial post is going to be short as it is basically just here to be here :D
