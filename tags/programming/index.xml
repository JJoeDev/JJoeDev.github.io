      <description>Programming language thoughts I feel like I am always looking for a different low level programming language alternative to C++, but always end up back at C++.&#xA;I have been looking at Zig lang, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to learn about their allocators, no good excuse really.&#xA;Then I have been looking at Odin lang, but last time I was trying it their linux support wasn&amp;rsquo;t really there. The Arch package was outdated and didn&amp;rsquo;t come with their vendor directory.</description>
